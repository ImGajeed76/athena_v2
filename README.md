## About Athena Learning

Athena Learning, commonly referred to as Athena, is an open-source web application designed to enhance the learning experience. Our platform is, and always will be, free to use. However, we plan to introduce a support option to ensure the continued development and sustainability of Athena.

Athena offers a variety of interactive learning modes, each tailored to enhance different aspects of the learning process. Here's a sneak peek at our core features:

### Cards
**Status:** Alpha  
Modeled after Quizlet, this feature allows users to create, learn from, and share their own educational sets. It's an interactive way to study and memorize key concepts.

### Slides
**Status:** Planned  
Drawing inspiration from Kahoot and Mentimeter, this mode enables the creation of slides with interactive elements like voting or gaming, perfect for engaging presentations.

### Quiz
**Status:** Planned  
This feature allows for the creation of quizzes or assignments. Users can craft questions with various response formats, such as multiple choice or text input. It supports detailed explanations and LaTeX formatting, making it versatile for different subjects.

### Pages
**Status:** Planned  
Imagine an interactive markdown file where you can both learn about a topic and immediately apply your knowledge through integrated questions. That's what Pages offers.

### Classes
**Status:** Planned  
A comprehensive suite that wraps all the above features, Classes is designed to manage class-related activities and enable group members to share resources and communicate effectively.

### Forums
**Status:** Planned  
An interactive chat forum to discuss and dissect exercises and topics, fostering a community of collaboration and learning.

## Roadmap

Our roadmap provides a glimpse into the future developments and enhancements planned for Athena Learning:

- **Short-term goals**: Focus on the stabilization and enhancement of the 'Cards' feature, start developing 'Slides' and 'Quiz' modes.
- **Mid-term goals**: Complete the development of 'Slides' and 'Quiz' modes, begin work on 'Pages' and 'Classes'.
- **Long-term vision**: Fully integrate all modes (Cards, Slides, Quiz, Pages, Classes, Forums) into a seamless learning experience, explore possibilities for AI-based learning tools, and expand the platform for global educational communities.
